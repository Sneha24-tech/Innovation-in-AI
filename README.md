# Innovation-in-AI
Exploring, experimenting, and building creative projects in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 🤖

## Motive 👩‍💻
- As we all know how fast our tech world is evolving rapidly- from system codes to software, everything is advancing with each passing day but one of the most revolutionary shifts we are witnessing is the rise of AI.
- AI has became one of the most fascinating field in today's world. From **SIRI** and **Google Assistent** to **Self-driving cars** etc are becoming a seamless part of everyday life.
- I am deeply curious and excited about the future of AI-- not because of it's growing demands but because of the innovation and imagination behind it. I would love to keep learning and applying what I know in real-world projects and would love to contribute meaningfully to this evolving tech world.🌐
